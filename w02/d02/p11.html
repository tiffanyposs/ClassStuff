<!--
  This is a drawing of a New Years ball dropping in 10 seconds

  This is a canvas the background is green with .width to take up the entire background

  Then there is a pole drawing red rectangle

  then i made a counter that is declared outside of the draw function
  the counter adds 1 and equales it adding 1 to y

  the if statements says when the counter = 400* (see below for why)
  then clearInterval is declared with the perameter of the variable clear
  declared below (so it will repeat until it equals 400, then it will clear/stop
  it)

  then the circle to move is drawn, and I use the counter y on the y axis to
  move it down the page.

  *if setInterval is set to 1000 thats 1 second, so if I repeat the counter inside
  10 times that would be 10 seconds. So if you want to ball to go further down
  you have to  you have to calculate it between the counter and the speed.
  You can do that be halfing the timer and doubling the counter.
