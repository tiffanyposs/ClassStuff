<!-- using form helpers, create a form that has a name of post and an action of update. there should be inputs prefilled with the existing value for title, author, and content. don't forget a submit button! after the form, create a cancel button that links back to index. -->

<!-- This now will link to the _form.html.erb page to render whatever.
This is good for multiple pages that have the same content -->

<%= render "layouts/form", post: @post %>
