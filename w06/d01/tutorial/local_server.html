  <h2>Running Locally: Testing Your Server-Client</h2>

  <h3>Organizing Files</h3>
  <p>In this section we will go over how to test your Server
    and Client code to make sure your chat app is is
    working properly.</p>

  <p>Make sure you have your server.js, client.js, index.html,
    node_modules folder, and package.json in the same folder.</p>

  <h3>Running your Servers</h3>

  <p>You need to run two servers for you chat app. The WebSocket
    server you wrote in this tutorial and an http server to host your
    html file and it's contents.</p>

  <p>In one window navigate navigate to the folder that contains
    all of your files. once you are in that file, type <i>node server.js</i>
    in the terminal and press enter.</p>

  <p>In the second terminal window type in <i>http-server</i> and press
    enter. This runs an http server so you html file will be hosted.</p>

  <h3>Opening in the Browser</h3>

  <p>Go to your web browser. To see your site type in <i>localhost:8080</i> 
    (http servers defalut to port 8080, when logging onto your http server
    if you were to type <i>http-server -p1000</i> your server would be running
    on port 1000 instead of 8080) Your basic html file should render. If you open
    multiple browser windows ang go to <i>localhost:8080</i> you can chat between
    browsers.</p>

  <p>Congradulations! Your server is working locally! Make sure you exit both of terminal
    servers by hitting <i>control C</i>. Now you can CSS style and add features to your chat
    app. Add a function that renders photos? Emojis?</p>
