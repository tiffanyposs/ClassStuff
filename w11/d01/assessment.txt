MVC stands for Model, Views, Controller. For me, this is still
somewhat conceptual for me, but after doing the forum project over
the weekend, I feel like I understand it a little more. As
of now my understanding is more specific to the projects we worked on,
and may not be specific to the general meaning of MVC.


Model- Models show how tables interact with each other.

Views- This is the actual pages that are viewed by the end user.

Controller- Controls what content goes where from and to the tables
to the views. 

We use MVC in order to have organized clean code. I believe that it allows
you to change one area of the code more easily without breaking code in other
areas. You are compartmentalizing different functions.
