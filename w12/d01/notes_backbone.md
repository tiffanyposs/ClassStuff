* Organization of code
	* Make up for having a ton of spaghetti code
* Organizing through:
	* Collections
	* Models
	* Views
	
###Models
* Deals with the data
	*  storing
	* 

###Collection
* A collection of models of one type
* Handle AJAX requests to the server
	* RESTful pattern
	
### Views

* Showing data on the DOM
	* Traditionally using a single model
* Respond to DOM events
* 




####Framework (Rails)
* Little Flexibility
* Powerful, but narrow

####Library (JQuery)
* Many small tools
* Not focused on big picture
